# ♟️ Chess Engine Project: Classic AI + RL

Build your own competitive chess engine in 8 weeks! This project combines **classical AI** (like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning) with **Reinforcement Learning** to create a fully functional engine you can play against.

> 🎯 Final showdown: Engine-vs-Engine tournament with a **prize** for the winner!

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
- Board representation & move generation
- Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, heuristics
- Zobrist hashing & transposition tables
- RL (Q-learning, self-play, policy tuning)

## 📅 Commitment
Expect ~5 hours/week. It’s a bit hectic but super rewarding!
